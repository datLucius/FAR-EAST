* MISSION STATEMENT

This repo is intended as a working tutorial and task management portal for my trip to Yosemite, Australasia and the Far East

* CURRENT STATUS

This repo will mainly utilize Github's `Wiki` feature along side `Issues` and a `Zenhub` initegration to help me build a living tutorial and handle travel related task management.

* ROADMAP

Ulitmately, I would love to glean a framework for travel planning / execution that can apply to future trips. This is with the hope that folks comfortable with github can capitalize on these tools to approach travel in a managed project way they are already familiar with.
